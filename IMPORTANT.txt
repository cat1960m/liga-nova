1) routing

The layout.txt in "app" is a root layout . 
The root layout is required and must contain html and body tags.

2) dynamic segment ([blog])

Wrapping a folder name in square brackets (e.g. [slug]) creates a special 
dynamic route segment used to generate multiple pages from data

3) navigate between routes (Link)

<Link href={`/blog/${post.slug}`}>{post.title}</Link>
<Link> is the primary and recommended way to navigate between routes in your Next.js application. 
However, you can also use the useRouter hook for more advanced navigation.

4) Image

The Next.js <Image> component extends the HTML <img>

<Image
      src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/my-bucket/profile.png"
      alt="Picture of the author"
      width={500}
      height={500}
/>
Since Next.js does not have access to remote files during the build process, you'll need to provide the width, height

to safely allow images from remote servers, you need to define a list of supported URL patterns in next.config.js

5) Fonts

The next/font module automatically optimizes your fonts and removes external network requests for improved privacy and performance.
